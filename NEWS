Roland Hieber, Sam Ravnborg, Sascha Hauer, Ulrich Ölmann, and Uwe Kleine-König. Thanks to all
contributors!

Changes:
* libdt: fix leaks of memory returned by read_file() calls
* libdt: xzalloc: die on failure, like the similar-named kernel function
* libdt: add of_property_write_string() as a convenience function to set a property to a string
* libdt: add dev_set_name() as a convenience function to set a device's name
* state: harmonize our implementation with upstream barebox:
  - Fixes:
    . backend_bucket_circular: fix the case when write size is not a power of 2
    . backend_bucket_circular: fix length check when reading old state format
    . backend_bucket_circular: fix two memory leaks
    . backend_storage: don't refresh the storage needlessly
    . fix error return value when state_new_from_node() cannot resolve a phandle
    . fix use-after-free in state_backend_format_dtb_pack()
    . make finding the backend node more robust by using its reproducible name
    . remove checks for xzalloc() returning NULL, which cannot happen
    . do not complain about missing backend-storage-type, which is irrelevant for mtd devices
  - Potentially breaking changes:
    . make pointing to the backend using a phandle the only supported method
    . state nodes without an alias in the /aliases/ node now lead to an error. barebox already creates
      a missing alias in the fixupped device tree automatically since v2017.06.0.
    . refuse to set the read-only 'dirty' state variable
    . remove unused arguments from state_new_from_node()
  - New features:
    . add new 'init_from_defaults' state variable to allow detection whether a state has been
      initialized from default values, i.e. state_load() failed.
    . add an internal variable to protect existing data in a state bucket and make updates of the
      state implementation more robust
    . add new function state_read_mac() to read a MAC address from state
    . notify when the old state format is detected (this was previously a debugging message)
    . provide an error message when an error occurs in state_convert_node_variable()
    . add more debugging messages
  - port several changes to barebox's fixup functions, but since device trees are already fixupped at
    boot time, this code is never used by dt-utils
  - some further minor refactoring as well fixing some typos and documentation comments
