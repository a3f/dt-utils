This project uses the Developer's Certificate of Origin, as stated in the file
DCO in this repository, with the same process as used for the Linux kernel:
<https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html#sign-your-work-the-developer-s-certificate-of-origin>
By adding a Signed-off-by line (e.g. using `git commit -s`) saying

  Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

(using your real name and e-mail address), you state that your contributions
are in line with the DCO.
